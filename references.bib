For obtaining a ``flat'' partition consisting of only the most significant clusters (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds), we propose a novel cluster stability measure, formalize the problem of maximizing the overall stability of selected clusters, and formulate an algorithm that computes an optimal solution to this problem. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current, state-of-the-art, density-based clustering methods on a wide variety of real world data.",

This strategy relies on offline-like track reconstruction in the high level trigger, making a separate offline event reconstruction unnecessary. To enable such reconstruction, and additionally keeping up with a higher event rate due to the accelerator upgrade, the time used by the track reconstruction had to be decreased. Timing improvements have in parts been achieved by utilizing parallel computing techniques that will be described in this document by considering two example applications. Despite decreasing computing time, the reconstruction quality in terms of reconstruction efficiency and fake rate could be improved at several places. Two applications of fast machine learning techniques are highlighted, refining track candidate selection at the early stages of the reconstruction.}

DANNs are designed to be trained in one domain (simulated data) but   tested in a second domain (physics data) and utilize unlabeled data   from the second domain so that during training only features which   are unable to discriminate between the domains are promoted.   MINERvA is a neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment using the NuMI   beamline at Fermilab.  A-dependent cross sections are an important   part of the physics program, and these measurements require vertex   finding in complicated events.  To illustrate the impact of the DANN   we used a modified set of simulation in place of physics data during   the training of the DANN and then used the label of the modified   simulation during the evaluation of the DANN.  We find that deep   learning based methods offer significant advantages over our prior   track-based reconstruction for the task of vertex finding, and that   DANNs are able to improve the performance of deep networks by   leveraging available unlabeled data and by mitigating network   performance degradation rooted in biases in the physics models used   for training.}

abstract="The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between {\textpm}1.",
